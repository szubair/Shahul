2. GroundFloor HALL
Provide square partitions
inside or outside?
Need to decide the movement/sliding of glasses
type of glass - not visible from outside

3. FF Balconies:
Wooden frames + grill + glass + manual lock
due to security reasons better go with wooden door as above.

---
1. Install sample windows first and review before giving full order 
2. Make in ALU is also fine
3. Need to decide to install windows inside or outside (better view)
