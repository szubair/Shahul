Hi --

This is regaring getting an NRE account with Bank-of-Baroda. The Bank manager asked me to share a residence address of Riyadh in the company letter pad. This NRE account is to receive the joining bonus and salary. The other account type like NRO will have tax (30%) payments. Therefore, could you please share this address in the company letter.


My joining date is september 11th and I'd buy a new laptop for offical purpose. is it possible that the company could reimbusement for this purchase. Please let me know how to go about it.
