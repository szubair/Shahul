## Things to discuss and finalize structural design of 2nd and 3rd floor
- Plan of duplex house in the second floor
- Finalize the location of staircase of the duplex house

## A few tuning in the second floor design:
- Minimize the floor area in the 3bhk - apartment:A (convert into a 2bhk or 2.5bhk) 
- change in the kitchen work area design (both apartments, half wall with opening, open kitchen etc..)

## Discussions on the Third floor:
- GYM area (this portion will be above apartment:B - around 1000 sqft or less)
- GYM area is a common place where all apartment folks could use.
- Lift area

## Design/Services needed in the duplex house:
- 2 bedrooms in the ground floor
- 2 bedrooms in the first floor
- kitchen + Dinning in the ground floor
- Need terrace area for gardening
- Need access from 3rd floor to duplex apartment first floor (direct)
