#planning for water, lighting etc

Water connection/expenses:
---------------------------
We have 5k litre water storage in the ground.
We will have 1k litre water-tank on the top for each flat.
We could have one motor per flat which upload water into the water-tank
Its good to have one water connection per flat so that these expenses will be calculated seperatly



Lighting connection/expenses:
-------------------------------
Car parking and ramp lights
staircase and corridor areas
