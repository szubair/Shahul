#planning for water, lighting etc

Water connection/expenses:
---------------------------
We have 5k litre water storage in the ground.
We have 1.5k litre water-tank on the top for each flat.
We could have one motor per flat which upload water into the water-tank - Single motor for now!
Its good to have one water connection per flat so that these expenses will be calculated seperatly


Lighting connection/expenses:
-------------------------------
Car parking and ramp lights
staircase and corridor areas
